Very interesting !
Right now, my company uses the "i2c_smbus_read/write_byte_data"=20
functions to talk to devices through an application. On the datasheet o=
f=20
these devices, I search but did not seem to be SMBus compliant.
As it was a software which was using these functions, we thought that a=
=20
driver (that I would write) should be better. And here I am ! I prefer=20
to understand well the mechanism before coding anything and it is=20
interesting !

Thanks for the explanation.
No problem, we have 2 devices used without drivers :
- an odometer PIC18F24201 : In the datasheet, there is a SMBus select=20
bit but I don't know if it is SMBus compliant.
- an audio codec tlv320aic3204 : There is a driver for this device but=20
for some reasons, we did not use it. Did not find a "SMBus compliant" i=
n=20
its datasheet.

Yes of course, I understand.

Thanks a lot for your help !
