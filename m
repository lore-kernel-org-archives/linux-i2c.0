Hi Wolfram

STM32 I2C F7 can be both Master and Slave mode.
Whenever a master command (I2C or SMBus) a START condition is generated and the
master flag (master_mode) is set and managed accordingly : sw and ITs/
Now if a slave is registered it's managed accordingly as long as there is no
master command on going.
IRqs are not separated neither Regs bits. The routing is done though out START
condition.
This driver is not slave-only driver and can act as master if a master command
is issued and slave if registered as such.

Hope it clarifies
Regards
