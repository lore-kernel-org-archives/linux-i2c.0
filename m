Might be. But the information is probably somewhere.

For you it might be a minor nitpick, for me (as a maintainer) it is not.
You have to deal with just one binding, I have to deal with many. And
since they have to be supported forever, this can easily mess up code
and make the subsystem clumsy and whatnot.

That's why I called it inbetween solution so the patch could go in.
It's fine if you don't like it, I prefer dropping the binding as well.

It would enable you to add the binding as an out-of-tree patch.

Yes. Adding all these properties is IMO not the right way, and I have
the impression they often came in because of time pressure like this. If
I think it is wrong for the kernel, I have to reject a patch unless I am
convinced otherwise. Which did not happen yet; as you found out
discussions on devicetree-discuss are slow. Might be another indication
that devictree things happen too much at the time currently. This is not
specific to your patch, there are more which need discussion or had to
be reworked.
