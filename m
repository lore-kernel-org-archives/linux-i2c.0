TL;DR: It's not needed, but it probably helps.

Consider someone sees a breakage in your driver in five years. By then
you either have other interests or at least forgot 95 % of the thoughts
you had when implementing the driver.

So when I see:

	val = DIV_ROUND_UP(i2c_dev->parent_rate, 400000 * 3);
	ccr |= STM32F4_I2C_CCR_CCR(val);
	writel_relaxed(ccr, i2c_dev->base + STM32F4_I2C_CCR);                                                                                                       

after seeing that the bus freq is wrong the obvious thoughts are:

 - Does this use the right algorithm?
 - Does this calculation result in values that are usable by the
   hardware?

That you thought about this today doesn't mean it's still right in five
years. During that time a new hardware variant is available with a
higher parent freq. Or there is a new errata available for the SoC.

So to help answer the questions above it helps if you add today the
formulas from the manual and a quick reason for why val fits into the
respective bits in the CCR register. That comment might be wrong until
then, too, but that only means you should make it easy to verify.
Something like:

	/* 
	 * Function bla_blub made sure that parent_rate is not higher
	 * than 23 * pi MHz. As a result val is at most 13.2 bits wide
	 * and so fits into the CCR bits.
	 */

This gives you in five years time the opportunity to quickly check
bla_blub if this is still true, add a printk for parent_rate to check
this, or quickly identify the bug in the code or the mismatch to the
manual.

Best regards
Uwe
