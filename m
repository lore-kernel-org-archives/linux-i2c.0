According to the register, IBB (bus busy) is cleared at this point. The
only remaining flag is UB (unit busy) and RW mode.

I am in master mode.

My manual says more or less the same thing. It says "unit not busy" but
quotes the IBB bit in braces. It is probably a typo.
The register say: ISR=00000005, ICR=000017e0, IBMR=01
So according to this I am not allowed to reset the I2C unit while it is
busy.

I tracked it down to the following: i2cdetect tries to read a byte from
address 47. This fails because there is no device. Then it goes for 48
which returns 0 (there is a device). The following read always fails. So I
guess the device at 48 is still sending data. What is general rule of
thumb in such a case?

Looks like it.
