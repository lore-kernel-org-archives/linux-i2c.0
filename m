This patch series adds support for Actions Semi Owl SoC family S700
I2C controller. S700 provides 4 I2C masters and with cubieboard7
2 (I2C0 and I2C1) are exposed.

Added pinctrl definition for I2C controllers in cubieboard7. This patch
depends on s700 pinctrl driver support (yet to be merged),

Changelog in v2:
- Initial version https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1011911/ only
added the I2C nodes using s900 compatible property. Now, new s700
compatiable string is added and used for S700
- Device tree bindings added with s700 compatible string
- pinctrl definition for cubieboard7
