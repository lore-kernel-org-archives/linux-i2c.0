Hi Andy,

Thanks for your comments. We have only added the patch for clearing
the error bits. This resetting of QUP is present in the base code
itself. Since this QUP is being used by all the QCOM chips that's why
we have not changed the existing QUP reset logic. We will look
into reset polling logic separately and will post the patch for the
same.

We got the input for QUP RESET by referring our working internal
drivers and we also faced the BAM hang issue in base upstream
driver, if we don't do this RESET. If we schedule any transfer
with DMA mode then the DMA Engine (BAM) will never get any interrupt
for these errors, since the QUP interrupt handles the error cases.
The BAM will generate the interrupt only when it will receive the
requested amount of data. This reset will clear the QUP FIFO and
we will get the BAM transfer completion interrupt by the existing
logic present in the base bam transfer function.
