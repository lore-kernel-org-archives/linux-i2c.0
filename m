This does many unrelated looking changes in one patch making it more 
vulnerable for potential multiple regressions. For instance busy 
checking goes from single read to loop with 250 ms timeout in this patch 
while changing also spin lock logic and interrupt handling.

Now if there is some regression it might be difficult to find what 
change in this patch is causing it and more over things goes more 
complicated if some other kind of regressions are found pointing into 
the same commit.

I suggest splitting this into multiple smaller patches. For instance 
having first simple conversions patches that are unlikely to cause a 
regression like one patch adding '\n' to error print, another moving 
irq_status variable into struct aspeed_i2c_bus and so on followed by 
patches that change logic like busy checking, spin lock change and then 
patch or more for multi-master support.
