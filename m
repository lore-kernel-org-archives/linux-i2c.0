can we get this testing with the Bluetooth SMP code? I would really like to see this being offloaded to hardware. For Bluetooth SMP we never really need the private key either. The end result is an symmetric 128-bit key for AES. And we throw the generated key pairs away.

With the limitation of private is not available to Linux directly, we should make sure that KPP users that don’t require the private key are working properly and can utilize the offload.

Regards

Marcel
