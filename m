QUP from version 2.1.1 onwards, supports a new format of i2c command tags. Tag codes instructs the controller to perform a operation like read/write. This new tagging version supports and is required for adding bam dma capabilities.
v2 tags supports transfer of more than 256 bytes in a single i2c transaction. Also adding bam dma support facilitates transferring each i2c_msg in i2c_msgs without a 'stop' bit in between which is required for some of the clients.

This series depends on the below bam dma bug fix

Tested this series on apq8074 dragon board eeprom client on i2c bus1
