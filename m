In case of overflow, the parent frequency has to be at least at 1431657 Mhz=
.
The STM32F4 SoC will never reach this value for any parent clock.
So, I think that this point is not really critical and you can
probably keep these simple lines of code without adding u32 overflow
checking for big frequency.

OK I will add more comments.

There are only 2 functions to handle this stuff:  handle_read() for
RXNE event and handle_rx_btf() for BTF event
I would prefer to keep 2 seperate functions to handle each event
according to buffer length as I don't have to do the same thing.
For example:
- for RXNE event with count =3D 2, I have to disable buffer interrupts
- for BTF event with msg count =3D 2, I have to .generate stop or
repeated start and disable all remaining interrupts.
I think that if I gather this stuff in one function, the code will be
less understandable.

Ok I will add these 2 functions in order to only use one status variable.
