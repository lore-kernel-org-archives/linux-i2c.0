Subject: [PATCH v6] i2c: cadence: Check for errata condition involving master receive

Cadence I2C controller has the following bugs:
- completion indication is not given to the driver at the end of
a read/receive transfer with HOLD bit set.
- Invalid read transaction are generated on the bus when HW timeout
condition occurs with HOLD bit set.

As a result of the above, if a set of messages to be transferred with
repeated start includes any message following a read message,
completion is never indicated and timeout occurs.
Hence a check is implemented to return -EOPNOTSUPP for such sequences.

v6:
- Correct if condition - add braces to include both statements.
- Modify comments and warning message.

v5:
Make warning grepable in driver.

v4:
Use single dev_warn and make message grep-able.

v3:
Add warning in case of unsupported transfer.

v2:
Dont defeteature repeated start. Just check for unsupported conditions in the
driver and return error.
