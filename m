i2c: qup: Add support for v2 tags and bam dma

QUP from version 2.1.1 onwards, supports a new format of i2c command tags.
Tag codes instructs the controller to perform a operation like read/write.
This new tagging version is required for adding bam dma capabilities.
V2 tags supports transfer of more than 256 bytes in a single i2c transaction.
Also adding bam dma support facilitates transferring each i2c_msg in i2c_msgs
without a 'stop' bit in between which is required for some of the clients.

Tested this series on apq8074 dragon board eeprom client on i2c bus1

[V7] Added tested-by tags and fixed a small comment

[V6] Added review tags and fixed a checkpatch warning in patch 4/6.

[V5] Addressed few more comments from Ivan T. Ivanov.
     Squashed patch 2 and 3 as no point in having only few lines of
     common code between v1 and v2 tags for increased complexity.
     Couple of non functional review comments fixes in patch 3, 4.
     Added a change in patch 4 to have proper transfer completion in
     a corner case. patch 5, 6 unchanged.

[V4] Added a patch to factor out some common code.
     Removed support for freq > 400KHZ as per comments.
     Addressed comments from Ivan T. Ivanov to keep the code for
     V2 support in a separate path.
     Changed the authorship of V2 tags support patch.

[V3] Added support to coalesce each i2c_msg in i2c_msgs for fifo and
     block mode in Patch 2. Also addressed further code comments.
