Aside from the flamewar in that thread, my impression is that in general
people (me certainly) prefer to have driver-local workarounds be expressed
in a driver specific way, not in a platform or architecture specific way
because that makes the driver less portable.

Anyway, I don't see this point as a show-stopper since the driver is already
platform specific, but it's generally a good idea to write code like this
defensively, if only to avoid getting comments about it.

But you are presenting the driver as a new one, so you should be
prepared to get review comments like any other new code.

Please at least move the data into the main driver file to get rid of
the header file.
