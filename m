I agree that the prose of the commit message could be cleaned up.  I
don't think English is Addy's primary language.  Your proposals sound
fine to me, though I would probably replace XYZ by "CLKDIV".  You
should capitalize I2C here, too.

He probably tested on rk3288-pinky, which is not an upstream board yet.

Can you please point out?  IIRC you should always capitalize I2C in
prose (descriptions, comments, documentation, etc).  However when used
in places which specific capitalization standards it should be
lowercase.  That means file names, directory names, device tree
property names, etc should be lower case.

I think Addy got it right in most cases and places where it's wrong
are probably my fault.  I think I missed a few in my patches.  :(

Chromium OS is part of the Chromium project.

This should have been I2C, not i2c (capital).

Same here: I2C.

=2E..and those should be I2C.

Could change this if need be, but the old code had it as "data hold".
Maybe we could argue about it in a future patch?

I believe I put it in an earlier bit of sample code when Addy was
worried about things being too close to the margins.  I'm not sure
what specifically Addy was worried about.  Maybe this should actually
be the falling time for data?

Again, this is not something new so perhaps we could debate in a future=
 patch?

One of these two properties is in another driver (the Designware one).
However, different hardware seems to take in different parameters for
I2C.  It seems like for now the best thing to do is to keep drivers
consistent.  If we notice a pattern then stuff should move to the
core.
