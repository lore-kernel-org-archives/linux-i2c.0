Yes, that would be the idea. I would not introduce platform_data for one
driver just for this though, because we are generally moving away from
platform_data towards device tree probing.

You can do it with a match table that has two entries with different
names for the two kinds of device that you need to distinguish and
set the platform_device_id->driver_data field to '1' for the type
that needs the fixup.

Ok, good. Moving it into the driver is really the important part anyway,
and I understand your reasoning for not wanting to modify the definitions,
it just didn't apply to the one of the two comments I made about the header.
