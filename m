This patch series fixes bugs/warnings, cleans up the code and adds
support for PXA910 family of devices to PXA I2C bus driver.

There has been one attempt made sometime back in 2012 to upstream
some of the patches from below list, but did not get follow up later.
I have consolidated all the patches, cleaned them up, splited into
logical changes, added new patches and submitting it now.

I tried to maintain authorship & Signoff except where I did some
significant changes to the code/logic.

Testing:
  - Boot tested on platform based on PXA1928
  - Probe is successfully passing

TODO:
  - Due to lack of client driver support as of now, could not
    able to do functionality testing from client. I am working
    on PMIC driver support which is over I2C, so will have good
    meaningful testing then.
