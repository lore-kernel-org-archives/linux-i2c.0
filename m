For me 9 =B5s + 16 =B5s is 25 =B5s, resulting in 40 kHz. That's why I wonde=

if there is a factor 10 missing somewhere.

IMHO that's a hw bug. This makes it for example impossible to implement
SMBus block transfers (I think).

So "Single byte reception" above is wrong, as this case is also used for
longer transfers and should be updated accordingly.

Can you please put this into the comment. "POS" isn't much helpful
there.

need to set the hardware bit for each byte or if it is retained in
hardware until unset by a register write.
