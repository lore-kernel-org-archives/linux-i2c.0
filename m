  Hi, Vaibhav:

  sorry there is something wrong with my mailbox, so I list the LCR/WCR
  information here, hoping not to confuse you;

  LCR: it's used to minor adjustments to the SCL, increasing it
  decreases the SCL frequency, vice versa;
  yes, it has relation with the I2C input clock:
  if input_clk = 32MHz, LCR = 0x0804_1c96
     LCR[SLV] = 0x096, bit 8~0
     LCR[FLV] = 0xe,   bit 17~9
     LCR[HLVH] = 0x1,  bit 26~18
     LCR[HLVL] = 0x1,  bit 31~27
  if input_clk = 52MHz,   LCR = 0x081c_60f9
  if input_clk = 62.4MHz, LCR = 0x082c_8330

  WCR: it's used to control setup and hold timing during slave mode
  WCR[31: 15], reserved, always write 0;
  WCR[14: 10], default 0x5, and should not be changed
  WCR[9: 5], default 0x1, and should not be changed
  WCR[4:0], default 0x1a, if input_clk = 33MHz, it's 0x0a;
                          if input_clk = 66MHz, it's 0x14;

  hope it's helpful;
