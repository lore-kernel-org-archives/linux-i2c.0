The I2C bus recovery is a feature which is not used during normal
operation and you won't find that it's not working unless something
unusual happens (probably only in a productive environment). It may even
be hard to trigger a condition to test the feature.
Thus IMO it is vital that the driver complains loudly if something is
missing to make this feature work if requested.
