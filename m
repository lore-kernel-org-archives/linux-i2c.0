Hi Sekhar,

Thank you for reviewing the series.

I'm not sure how the 20us in the existing method was derived -- I
wonder if Philby John or John Povey could comment? I agree that the
5us suggested by Brad assumes a 100KHz bus -- I could certainly derive
this delay from the bus_freq platform data for the new recovery
procedure since board-da850-evm.c sets bus_freq to 100 kHz.

But I was apprehensive to do so for the existing recovery procedure
since the two (in-tree) boards that are assigning the scl_pin member
are dm355 and dm644x which assign bus_freq values of 400kHz and 20kHz,
respectively. These would require delays of 1.25us and 25us,
respectively; neither of which is the hard-coded 20us. To complicate
matters further, dm644x (20kHz) sets bus_delay to 100us with a comment
that "the msp430 uses a slow bitbanged i2c implementation [...] which
requires 100us of idle after i2c writes [...]." If I derived the
clock-pulse delays from bus_freq the dm644x would probably still work
but if the clock-pulse width was at all important for dm355 then the
recovery procedure could fail there. I don't want to introduce
instabilities into other platforms.

This testing was performed using the 'new' ICPFUNC-based GPIO toggling.

At the outset I had hoped so too; but what we have in the result is a
method proven to work on the problem hardware here that is now
different than the existing method.

Ok -- I did not want to break behaviour on other hardware with my
changes --but I respect your expert opinion coming from the experience
you have in merging patches as a kernel mach maintainer. I will
re-spin (not immeadiately -- I don't expect to be able to return to
development of this patch series for another couple weeks) another
version, this time replacing the existing recovery procedure with the
tested method here. Also, allowing the individual da8xx boards to
specify whether they enable the recovery procedure as you requested in
reviewing 6/6 of this series. I would still prefer to do the
extraction to i2c-algo-bit in a separate series.

Best Regards,
Ben Gardiner
