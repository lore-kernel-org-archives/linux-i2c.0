You need privileges to change the bus frequency, so this is a
configuration issue. Which you still have today, since can still set
the i2c frequency on some busses via a module parameter.

Yes, I will do that for v2 and in addition I will also add min and max
attributes to make it easier to determine if a bus supports fast mode,
fast plus, high, etc.
