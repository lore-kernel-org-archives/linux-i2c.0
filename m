Correct.

Also correct.

What I'm saying was that the binding file could just document both
cases as alternatives. We prefer to specify the clocks directly
when using a dtb, but for the driver one of the two is ok, and
the ACPI documentation will already have to refer to the DT binding
for the other properties, so I think it makes sense to describe
both the "clocks" and "src-clock-hz" properties in the same document
as optional properties and clarify that at least one of the two
is requried.

Note that we have traditionally used "clock-frequency" as the
property name for the input clock frequency in DT bindings that
predate the generic clock handling (e.g. 8250 uarts on IBM Power
servers), so we could use the same here.
