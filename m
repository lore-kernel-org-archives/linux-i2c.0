Part of the reason I was querying this is that you were using the clock
name "dw_i2c_clk" which looks like a globally namespaced name which
would be used with option 3 above.  Several clock frameworks just
completely ignore dev_id which creates a lot of problems down the line.
If it had just been i2c_clk I'd have been less likely to follow up.

Option 3 has never been the intended use of the clock API and is
basically a bug in any clock implementation that requires it for most
drivers but it does need to be used in a few limited cases where the
relevant kernel subsystem doesn't provide a struct device (cpufreq is
the major offender here).

As far as I can tell from what rmk is saying it seems that the use of a
NULL string is actually an intended usage for devices where the clocks
aren't otherwise named.  I had the concerns when I first saw this usage
but it does seem to be an expected and intended use.

To a certain extent this is good in that it applies pressure to improve
the clock API implementations concerned.
