Eric, does this look good to you as a code comment:

/*
  * Note about I2C_C_CLEAR on error:
  * The I2C_C_CLEAR on errors will take some time to resolve -- if you 
were in
  * non-idle state and I2C_C_READ, it sets an abort_rx flag and runs through
  * the state machine to send a NACK and a STOP. Since we're setting CLEAR
  * without I2CEN, that NACK will be hanging around queued up for next time
  * we start the engine.
  */


If it is, I'll resend the series with this change and add all the ack's 
and r-b's.

Noralf.
