Perhaps we could agree on the binding first? Currently, I have the followin=
g

    Device (I2C0) {
      Name (_HID, "SCX0003")
      Name (_UID, Zero)
      Name (_CRS, ResourceTemplate () {
        Memory32Fixed (ReadWrite, SYNQUACER_I2C1_BASE, SYNQUACER_I2C1_SIZE)
        Interrupt (ResourceConsumer, Level, ActiveHigh, Exclusive) { 197 }
      })

      Name (_DSD, Package ()  // _DSD: Device-Specific Data
      {
        ToUUID ("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
        Package () {
          Package (2) { "socionext,pclk-rate", 62500000 },
        }
      })

and I don't intend to add 'clock-frequency' here because it would be
redundant anyway.

Does this look sane?
