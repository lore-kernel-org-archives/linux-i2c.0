To some degree I may say yes it is.

What kind? clock-frequency? Does it require prefix?

No, those methods because of windows driver and existed ACPI tables at
that time.
You are not supposed to uglify your case.

OTOH the deviation in the driver is what I absolutely against of.
Driver must not know the resource provider (ideally at all).

Again, looking into existing examples (UART, I2C, etc) we better to
create a generic helper in clock framework that would provide us a
clock based on property value.
But doing different paths for different resource providers is not what
we are looking for.

P.S. To move this somehow forward I may propose to submit an OF
driver, and discuss ACPI part after.
