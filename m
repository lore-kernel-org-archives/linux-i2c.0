I'm not sure my change set will affect anything..
Current drivers using the gpio functions are requesting the gpio using the old interface.
If releasing the gpio doesn't restore the original functionality than nothing changes with this series.

For the designware driver, the recovery code wont be called unless the gpio's are specified via the device tree.
So the pinmux config shouldn't get changed.

It'd be nice to have the code in mainline even if most soc's can't use it as yet.
