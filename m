Aa far as looking through the source code, I know that it's broken
without giving it a try with real DW I2C hardware ;-), but that'
not a big problem.

As said in the covermail, your initial work, namely i2c_dw_xfer(),
i2c_dw_xfer_msg(), and i2c_dw_read() is well-designed, this _is_
very important.  That makes further enhancements of DW I2C
transactions much easier, and makes me decide to post the patches.

Thanks, will do.

I added more 4-5 patches fixing transmit abort handling, and misc
updates all over the patchset (typos, comments, better logics).
They will come up, hopefully, next week.
