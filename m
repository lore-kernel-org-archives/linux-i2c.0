Depending on running pcie when calling is tricky, as it can be clock
gated. Maybe we should have some mach code to get the SoC revision
early for all SoCs. That should look for a pcie controller node,
enable the clock, store the revision once, and disable the clock
again. The callback can then return the stored value.

I know that DT should describe HW, but at this point I tend to not
fork off another dts. If it is probable, we should probe it. SoC
revisions are really hard to see even from looking at the pcb, there
is no way for users to determine the correct dts.
