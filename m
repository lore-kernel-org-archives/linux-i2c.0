OK, but if a client driver assumes default inactive power state it will 
expect
its callbacks to get called. Otherwise exisiting code might break. So, e.g.
in case of s5p-tv it would rather need to be something like:

	pm_runtime_put()

	pm_runtime_get_sync()
  	sii9234_verify_version()
  	pm_runtime_put(dev)

Note that client drivers usually call pm_runtime_enable() only when it 
is safe
to call their driver's runtime PM callbacks. By enabling runtime PM 
before the
client's driver has completely initialized we may risk that the 
callbacks are
executed with uninitialized data, if I understand things correctly.

Yes, considering this driver in isolation it should be fine.

However, I observed system suspend issues when the I2C bus controller was
being activated (which would happen in the I2C core after your changes)
before some other driver has initialized.

So to ensure things continue to work the "fimc-isp-i2c" driver would need
to be registered after the "exynos4-fimc-is" driver has initialized. Or the
"exynos4-fimc-is" would need to call of_platform_populate() to instantiate
its all children devices as specified in device tree (see arch/arm/boot/dts/
exynos4x12.dtsi in -next). "simple-bus" would then have to be not listed in
the compatible property of that top level device. So to avoid regressions
some additional changes would be needed, outside of this particular I2C
client driver. I guess this could be avoided by better design of the
exynos4-is driver right from the beginning. But it's all some times tricky
when there is some many IP blocks involved and the hardware behaviour/device
interactions are not always well documented.
