OK, that all makes sense, but I don't think there's any change at all to 
the binding; this can all be fixed in the driver without affecting the 
definition of the binding at all. At most all that's needed in the 
binding is a note to the effect that if a particular child node is 
disabled, then this has no effect at all on the requirements for the 
pinctrl properties.

Yes, I have both Seaboard and Ventana still (the two Tegra boards that 
use this driver). I haven't used them in a while; I hope they still work:-)
