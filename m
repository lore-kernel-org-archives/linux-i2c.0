Yes, the command is either "read" or "write" (meaning even for Rx a
write to the Tx FIFO is needed).

I guess for Rx we would need to supply a dummy buffer of "read" commands
for the Tx FIFO in addition to reading bytes from Rx FIFO. But still
that might help to improve reliability in case of Juno.

OK
