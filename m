Hmmm,

Just saw pxa27x manual, and you are right.
In that case I am not sure how to address the issue mentioned in the
changelog.

On the other side,

Check for ISR_IBB, should be ok, as, as per spec it says,

"Set when the TWSI bus is busy but the SoC TWSI is not
involved in the transaction."

Also,
I believe we should be ok, as the first thing we do in i2c_pxa_reset()
is abort the current transaction and then assert reset. Isn't it?

Any condition check you can possibly think of for asserting reset???

Having said that,
Somewhere I do agree with you that we need to further debug on noise
issue in HW rather hacking software. :)

I am ok to drop this patch, do further testing and revisit again if
issue persist.

Thanks,
