Great thanks for your feedback, I will send it with Cyrille's one.

The twi device has a weird behavior (solved on SAMA5D2) when it concern=
s
reception. It sounds as when I have almost received a byte, I will do
internal stuff to prepare the reception of a new byte. If I have
received the order to send a stop command, this internal stuff should
not be done and everything goes well. But if the order is received too
late, the twi device may think it's still receiving data and set the
RXRDY flag. For that reason we don't set the stop order on the last dat=
a
but on the second last data. Unfortunately, it seems we still have bad
timing in some cases.
