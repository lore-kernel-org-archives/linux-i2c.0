Yeah, ok, so you're basically confirming everything I said. I do
sense some confusion though, as you come across as a bit
defensive and seem to think that I am against the whole notion of
the patches. And that's not the case at all! My only issue is
with the naming. And I happen to think hw-timeout-ms is a really
bad name. It's way too broad and can mean just about anything.
When I read that, I think of some workaround for broken hardware,
not normal things like the other masters on the bus doing
confusing things. Funky bus activity from remote masters is
simply not an HW issue in my book, at least not an HW issue on
the local side of the bus. It's just something you *must expect*.

Let me list some scenarios, so that I can describe why I came up
with my suggested alternate naming:

Suppose you have a simple setup with a bus featuring a single
aspeed master and a single slave. If the slave is, say, a jc42
temperature sensor, then it by default will follow the SMBus spec
and implement a bus timeout. Meaning that if the master is
stalling for too long, then the jc42 slave will timeout the
transaction and make itself available to any potential other
masters on the bus. The jc42 chip does not know that it is on a
single master bus. But this is only the default, you can tell the
jc42 driver to disable this timeout, which is sometimes crucial
for reliable behavior, e.g. if the master is not always able to
keep the deadlines for whatever reason.

Next scenario. Suppose you have a simple setup with a bus
featuring a single remote master of some sort and the aspeed
acting as slave only. Since there is only a single master, and
there are no other slaves on the bus, there's no point for the
aspeed to act as master. The aspeed without your patches behave
as the jc42 chip above, when it has been instructed to /remove
the timeout/. And that's fine in this scenario since there is
only one master and the aspeed, as slave, can defer recovering
the bus to that master. So, when aspeed is operating as
slave-only, these patches enable the addition of the same timeout
that was there by default in the first scenario.

Final scenario, some as last but with some other slave(s) on the
bus. Now, it becomes interesting for the aspeed to act as master,
and it becomes interesting indeed to have a timeout that "breaks
out" when some remote master hogs the aspeed in slave mode.

I claim that the timeouts mentioned in all these scenarios are
related. In the first scenario, you disable the timeout by adding
smbus-timeout-disable to the relevant device tree node. I was
merely suggesting that, since the timeouts are basically doing
the same thing in all scenarios, the naming should perhaps be
consistent and be something more specific than hw-timeout-ms. What
popped up was bus-timeout-ms or smbus-timeout-ms. I suppose
remote-timeout-ms, or something, would also work...

Note that the timeouts I'm talking about has nothing to do with
the adapter timeout in the linux I2C core. This is all about
timeouts when acting as I2C slave and the remote master fails to
complete (or otherwise messes up) transfers.

I hope that clarifies my position!

Cheers,
Peter
