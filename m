In case of i2c-designware, this is safe because that driver does not perform
DMA. In other drivers, you may have to be more careful, to ensure that all MMIO
is serialized with DMA operations performed by the driver.

I would definitely welcome a patch that adds a default  _relaxed implementation
to include/linux/io.h, like this:

#ifndef readb_relaxed
#define readb_relaxed(p) readb(p)
#endif

and then adds "#define readb_relaxed(p) readb_relaxed(p)" etc. to all
architectures that have a non-macro definition for readb.

Alternatively, we could have a CONFIG_ARCH_MMIO_RELAXED configuration
symbol that gets selected by any architecture that provides the _relaxed
accessors, and get linux/io.h to define all of them for the other
architectures.
