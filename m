I think you put too much attention in the name.

There are just name referring a specific hardware. I don't think
there is a consideration of order. For instance this driver also
work with allwinner,sun4i-i2c, here we can clearly see that this
compatible don't describe a newer or an older version of the device
it just describe an "other" version.


About this whole series how do you plan to handle it?
It was acked by Wolfram and even by Arnd.

This series is for fixing a bug so it should be part of the stable
kernels including the 3.13. However we are so close to the release
of the 3.13, that it seems to be too late.

At least I hope it can be pushed to the arm-soc-next and be part of the
3.14-rc1. What do you think about it?


Thanks,

Gregory
