I assumed the new driver handles the HW quirks better than the old atmel-twi
driver(?). So the RM9200 i2c HW is at least usable with this driver.

I didn't encounter any problems during my short testing using a couple of
different i2c devices. As far as I can remember the old driver didn't even
handle the devices I tested with the new driver.
