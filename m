Ok, I see. But it isn't documented in the public FS, is it? If there is
an extra powerdown register for each ip block, I guess it will also
break reading from its registers.

True. But I still wonder how many users will find the correct dtb
without knowing the SoC revision. Having it probed would be best for
users, but I see the difficulties.

We should really work harder on proper u-boot/barebox for all those
Orion SoCs to have at least the option to update it with DT support.
