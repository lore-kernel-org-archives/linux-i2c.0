This patchset adds I2C controller support for Actions Semiconductor S900 SoC.
This driver has been structured in a way such that there will be only
one controller driver for the whole Owl family series (S500, S700 and
S900 SoCs).

There are 6 I2C controllers with separate memory mapped register space.
The I2C controller can handle atmost two messages concatenated by a
repeated start via its internal address feature. Hence the driver
uses this feature for messages of length greater than 1. In those cases,
the first message of the combined message should be a `write` with maximum
message length 6 and the second message's maximum length should be 240 bytes.

As far as the bus speed is concerned, this driver only supports
Standard (100KHz) and High speed (400KHz) for now.

The pinctrl definitions are only available for I2C0, I2C1 and I2C2.
With the mux option available only for I2C0.

For Bubblegum-96 board utilizing the S900 SoC, only I2C1 and I2C2 which
are exposed on the Low speed expansion connector are enabled.

This series depends on the pinctrl patch [1] is still not merged by the
platform maintainer Andreas but it has been reviewed by the pinctrl maintainer
Linus Walleij. For the reference, I have queued up all reviewed dts patches
in my tree [2] from which Andreas is picking them for 4.19.

For this series, since the dts patches will go through the ARM SoC tree,
Andreas will pick it up once it is reviewed.

Thanks,
Mani

Changes in v3:

As per Peter, Andy and Andreas review:

* Removed owl_i2c_reset function from interrupt handler since is
  involves the use of delays.
* Fixed the return path in owl_i2c_master_xfer and added a note
* Changed "base" parameter to "reg" in owl_i2c_update_reg for better
  understandability
* Ordered the includes in alphabetical order
* Small changes to defines and added comma at the end of struct members
* Removed rendundant 0 assignment in owl_i2c_master_xfer
* Changed all OWL naming convention to Owl and also changed Actions Semi
  Actions Semiconductor

Changes in v2:

As per Andy's review:
* Modified infinite loops to fixed number of retries
* Used i2c_8bit_addr_from_msg for constructing the slave address
* Removed unnecessary parenthesis around defines
* Modified certain dev_warn to dev_dbg
* Modified the error handling to more generic pattern

* Fixed the return value in owl_i2c_master_xfer
* Added MAINTAINERS patch for I2C driver and its binding
