I wonder how these values (5us or 20us) are derived. The document[1]
referred to in the existing code says that "the master should send
9 clock pulses". I think 5us suggested by Brad assumes a 100KHz
bus. If that is so, this number should be derived out of the bus_freq
platform data.

Was this testing done with the original PinMuxed GPIO based approach or with
the new internal GPIO based approach?

Yes, the document referred to above suggests this too.

I guess the existing recovery mechanism and the new ICPFUNC
based approach shouldn't be functionally different - correct?

In that case, it would really be worthwhile to fix the existing
recovery method as well.

I think if you see issues with existing code, you should just
go ahead and fix. AFAICT, the existing approach should have
worked for you. You can test on your hardware and those with
other hardware can test your patches as well and send their
acks.
