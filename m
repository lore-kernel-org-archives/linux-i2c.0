I agree at many places I could save registers read by not using
clr_bits and set_bits function when the registers in question has been
already read.
But it is not enough to get rid of the clr_bits and set_bits function.
For example when calling stm32f4_i2c_terminate_xfer(), the CR1
register is never read before so set_bits function is useful.
Another example, when stm32f4_i2c_handle_rx_done(), the CR1 register
is also never read before so clr_bits finction is again useful.
