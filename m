With the clock change below, suspend and resume won't be needed anymore.

All the I2C patches work fine. In regards to the clock being enabled on
suspend, I think that's a bug - it should be disabled. It only uses extra
power keeping the clock gated on when an I2C transaction isn't in progress.
The clock can be gated on prior to an I2C transaction starting and
then gated off at the end of it. This will save a small trickle of power.

I'll send over patch with these changes.
