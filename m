The alternative command mode was introduced to simplify the transmission of
STOP conditions and to solve timing and latency issues around them.

This mode relies on a new register, the Alternative Command Register, which
must be set at the same time as the Master Mode Register. This new register was
designed to allow simple setup of basic combined transactions built from
up to two unitary transactions.

Indeed, the ACR is split into two areas, which describe one unitary
transaction each. Each area is filled with Data Length 8bit counter, a
Direction and a PEC Request bit. The PEC bit is only used in SMBus mode and is
not supported by this driver yet. Also when using alternative command mode, the
MREAD bit from the Master Mode Register is ignored. Instead the Direction bits
from ACR are used to setup the direction, read or write, of each unitary
transaction. Finally the 8bit counters must filled with the data length of
their respective transaction. Then if only one transaction is to be used, the
data length of the second one must be set to zero. At the moment, this driver
uses only the first transaction.

In addition to MMR and ACR, the Control Register also need to be written to
enable the alternative command mode. That's the purpose of its ACMEN bit, which
stands for Alternative Command Mode Enable.

Note that the alternative command mode is compatible with the use of the
Internal Address Register. So combined transactions for eeprom read are
actually implemented with the Internal Address Register. This register is written
with up to 3 bytes, which are the internal address sent to the slave through
the first write transaction. Then the first area of the ACR describe the write
transaction to follow, which carries the data to be read from the eeprom.
The second area of the ACR is not used so its Data Length 8bit counter is
cleared.

For each byte sent or received by the device, the Data Length 8bit counter is
decremented. When it reaches 0, a STOP condition is automatically sent.

+	 * empty and STOP condition has been sent.
+	 * Consequently, when using alternative command, we should enable NACK
+	 * interrupt rather than TXCOMP to detect transmission failure.
+	 * Indeed let's take the case of an i2c write command using DMA.
+	 * Whenever the slave doesn't acknowledge a byte, the LOCK, NACK and
+	 * TXCOMP bits are set together into the Status Register.
+	 * LOCK is a clear on write bit, which is set to prevent the DMA
+	 * controller from sending new data on the i2c bus after a NACK
+	 * condition has happened. Once locked, this i2c peripheral stops
+	 * triggering the DMA controller for new data but it is more than
+	 * likely that a new DMA transaction is already in progress, writing
+	 * into the Transmit Holding Register. Since the peripheral is locked,
+	 * these new data won't be sent to the i2c bus but they will remain
+	 * into the Transmit Holding Register, so TXCOMP bit is cleared.
+	 * Then when the interrupt handler is called, the Status Register is
+	 * read: the TXCOMP bit is clear but NACK bit is still set. The driver
+	 * manage the error properly, without waiting for timeout.
+	 * This case can be reproduced easyly when writing into an at24 eeprom.
+	 *
+	 * Besides, the TXCOMP bit is already set before the i2c transaction
+	 * has been started. For read transactions, this bit is cleared when
+	 * writing the START bit into the Control Register. So the
+	 * corresponding interrupt can safely be enabled just after.
+	 * However for write transactions managed by the CPU, we first write
+	 * into THR, so TXCOMP is cleared. Then we can safely enable TXCOMP
+	 * interrupt. If TXCOMP interrupt were enabled before writing into THR,
+	 * the interrupt handler would be called immediately and the i2c command
+	 * would be reported as completed.
+	 * Also when a write transaction is managed by the DMA controller,
+	 * enabling the TXCOMP interrupt may lead to a race condition since
+	 * we don't know whether the TXCOMP interrupt is enabled before or after
+	 * the DMA has started to write into THR. With alternative command
+	 * mode, we never enable TXCOMP interrupt but use DMA controller
+	 * completion interrupt instead.
+	 * Without alternative command mode, we still need to send the STOP
+	 * condition manually writing the corresponding bit into the Control
+	 * Register. So we enable TXCOMP interrupt at the same time.
