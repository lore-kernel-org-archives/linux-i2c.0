It complains that data might be undefined, do you want it in a separate patch 
then ?

Obviously.

I still havent figured out how to flip between pioqueue mode and dma mode 
without the controller getting confused, so I prefer to postpone it into 
subsequent patch. Eventually, I agree it'd be cool to be able to do this 
switching.

Yes, that's what I have in V2.

I'll have a V2 patch for you by ... in a bit ;-) Also, you can grab latest 
version here (will be updated before I submit V2):
