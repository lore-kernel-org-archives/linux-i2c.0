I would prefer if you could explain why other controllers do have DMA disabled 
even if the hardware does support the DMA operation.

I'd say try it, the RX and TX callback look almost the same. So does the 
i2c_imx_dma_rx() and i2c_imx_dma_tx() .

Sorry, I don't quite understand this. If you have two DMA channels, can you not 
use them both to do full-duplex SPI transfer ?

This doesn't check whether the completion is actually finished anywhere. I don't 
quite understand how this is safe .

The dma_read() looks almost like dma_write(), so I'd also try merging them 
together.
