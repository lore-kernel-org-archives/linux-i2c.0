Let's not rush. The qemu model was written in order to allow us to
test the kernel code, and was validated by the kernel driver we have.
We've had situations in the past (with the i2c driver in fact) where a
change in the driver required an update of the model to be more
accurate.

I suggest we wait until Cedric has a chance to look at the issue
before reverting the patch.

Cheers,

Joel
