Sorry, I don't understand your points here. If this limitations exists
they are not introduced by this patch. This patch just exposes the
frequency so that it can be read or changed in userspace.

Changing the frequency is limited to root. Also, bus drivers do not
have to implement set_freq if it is thought not to be safe.

On a different not, I have noticed that a fixed set of frequencies
might not be the best API, since multiple drivers rather support a
rather large set of frequencies in a range. A better API might be to
expose a min-max range and let the bus driver adjust the requested
frequency. I will follow up with a second version that does that.
