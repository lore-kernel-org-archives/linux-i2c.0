This does not seem to implement the i2c_msg api correctly.

As per comments in include/uapi/linux/i2c.h on line 58 only the last message
in a group should - by default - send a STOP.

As far as I understand  you would need to implement the I2C_M_STOP flag
(by exposing  I2C_FUNC_PROTOCOL_MANGLING in bcm2835_i2c_func)
to make this work correctly:

  	for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
+		bool send_stop = (i == num - 1) ||msgs[i] <http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?i=msg>->flags <http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?i=flags>  &I2C_M_STOP <http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?i=I2C_M_STOP>;
-		ret = bcm2835_i2c_xfer_msg(i2c_dev, &msgs[i]);
+		ret = bcm2835_i2c_xfer_msg(i2c_dev, &msgs[i], send_stop);
  		if (ret)
  			break;
  	}

The corresponding device driver (or userspace) will need to set the flag 
correctly.
