The only thing we have tested PL330 with was UART and I2S. I'm not sure we
can really use it with I2C given the above hardware configuration issue.

The other thing we have tried in our private branches was to repeat the EDID
transfer a number of times until the checksum was correct. Andrew Jackson
sent a patch a year or so back to have some ridiculously high number of
retries (30) and that has been rightfully shut down in the upstream.

The unfortunate thing is that the monitors and TVs that we use inside ARM
for testing don't seem to trigger this issue on a regular basis. We had one
or two small 7" TVs that did that, and the brute force retry of EDID transfer
sorted them out for the limited use that we had for them.

Best regards,
Liviu
