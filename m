It's a pattern over ACPI vs. clk cases at least for now.
But hold on. We have already an example of dealing with ACPI /
non-ACPI cases for I2C controllers =E2=80=94 i2c-designware-platdrv.c.
Check how it's done there.

I actually totally forgot about ACPI slaves described in the table. We
need to take into account the ones with lowest bus speed.

Unfortunately, we are strong against deviations between DT and ACPI in
case of device properties.
You may provide a clock and use devm_clk_get() without any concerns
from where this comes from.

You won't find any deviation in DW I2C driver since there is none,
while driver works for non-ACPI platforms as well.
