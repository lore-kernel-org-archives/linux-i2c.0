If CONFIG_PINCTRL is not enabled, the devm_pinctrl_get() will return
NULL directly as defined in the include/linux/pinctrl/consumer.h.

If CONFIG_PINCTRL is enabled because we are using a multi-platform
image but the actual hardware used doesn't have a pinctrl driver or
pinctrl device tree nodes.  It is expected that the devm_pinctrl_get()
will return error.  But as the pinctrl is only used for bus recovery
which is just an optional function of this driver.  We shouldn't
bailout the probe but keep the driver working without the bus recovery
function.  As for generic errors like (!dev) or out-of-memory, the
probe will fail elsewhere anyway.
