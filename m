You are right. The pinctrl patch [1] is still not merged by the platform
maintainer Andreas but it has been reviewed by the pinctrl maintainer
Linus Walleij. For your reference, I have queued up all reviewed dts patches
in my tree [2] from which Andreas is picking them for 4.19.

For this series, since the dts patches will go through the ARM SoC tree,
Andreas will pick it up once it is reviewed.

Hope this clarifies!

Thanks,
Mani
