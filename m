The series attempts to do the following

- The reset should not be done in the driver 
  have support for the same.
- Remove the sysc register access in the driver.


Incorporated review comments:

 - Fix the indentation.
 - Restore in the error path is not needed as we are
   doing a init.
 - Combine the patch 1 and 2 as i2c-omap.h isn't a generic header
 - Making the changelogs more descriptive.
 
This is rebased on Kevin's tree  for_3.2/fixes/i2c branch.


Acknowledge Balaji ,Santosh and Kevin for the review comments.
