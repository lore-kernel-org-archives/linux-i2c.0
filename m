Exactly, the only issue is the message, the bus looks good and transfer=
s
work as they should AFAICT.

Agreed, this is not about the extra frame caused by the spurious write
to the THR register. This is something else.

One suspicion is that the driver gets an unexpected irq from its own
NACK (the one that it puts out to end the read) and races with the
expected interrupt at TXCOMP?
