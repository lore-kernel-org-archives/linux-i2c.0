Hello Tao,
	Our recommend about clk divider setting is follow the datasheet clock setting table for clock divisor.

Thank you for the quick response, Brendan.

Aspeed I2C bus frequency is defined by 3 parameters (base_clk_divisor, clk_high_width, clk_low_width), and I choose base_clk_divisor because it controls all the Aspeed I2C timings (such as setup time and hold time). Once base_clk_divisor is decided (either by the current logic in i2c-aspeed driver or manually set in device tree), clk_high_width and clk_low_width will be calculated by i2c-aspeed driver to meet the specified I2C bus speed.

For example, by setting I2C bus frequency to 100KHz on AST2500 platform, (base_clock_divisor, clk_high_width, clk_low_width) is set to (3, 15, 14) by our driver. But some slave devices (on CMM i2c-8 and Minipack i2c-0) NACK byte transactions with the default timing setting: the issue can be resolved by setting base_clk_divisor to 4, and (clk_high_width, clk_low_width) will be set to (7, 7) by our i2c-aspeed driver to achieve similar I2C bus speed.

Not sure if my answer helps to address your concerns, but kindly let me know if you have further questions/suggestions.


Thanks,

Tao
