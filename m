I said I'm not going to ack the changes, not I'm NAKing the changes.
But since you have put me on that position, ok, I'm now NAKing the
changes.  The reason is obvious, you are adding something we are trying
hard to remove.

The i2c-mxs driver currently does not use platform_data at all, the
first patch creates a new file include/linux/i2c/mxs-i2c.h to introduce
it.

I take it in the opposite way.  It's helpful for MXS, especially
in the long run.

All the examples you put here are submitted in this development cycle,
how can they make the MXS support much better already without waiting
v3.5-rc1 to hit the mainline?

I would expect the support will hit mainline in a few weeks with
v3.5-rc1, so none of the examples you put here, neither SPI driver
nor I2C changes, can really hit the mainline earlier than DT.

This is a new driver.

That's a bit unfortunate.  Let me put an interesting story here.
When Huang Shijie adds DT support for gpmi-nand driver, he chooses to
not maintain the compatibility of non-DT support to make the code
a lot clean and simple.  When I asked how he can do this before all
those non-DT board files are converted to DT, I was reminded that
is not a problem because I rejected his board file changes coming along
with the driver, there is no in-tree board files are users of gpmi-nand
driver.  What I put here is it's much easier and cleaner to create a DT
only driver from the beginning than having a non-DT driver and then
converting it to DT.

If they do not get reposted to have DT support from the beginning,
I believe other people will do when the need of the patches are seen.
