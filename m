OK, then here is where the problem is, because you're building ACPI
assumptions into the core. For non-ACPI devices, this part is a nop, so
the client device is still powered off, which breaks the assumptions
below.

Yes, but until now, default to suspended has been assumed, so any
changes to that will likely require more thorough auditing of other drivers.
