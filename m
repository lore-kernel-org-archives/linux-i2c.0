I think here we should pour more details like what you wrote in the
commit log. Maybe something like:

                        - "marvell,mv78230-a0-i2c": for controller which
                          do not support offload but still have the i2c
                          repeated start timing violation issue, such as
                          the ones found in the Armada XP A0 and the
                          Armada 38x SoCs.


And I still have to check it for Armada 375 and Armada 39x, but of
course it is not preventing merging your patches.
