The "Mux" box should be outside the SoC, since it isn't part of the SoC
itself but something external.

Perhaps just "mux-gpios"? Bikeshedding, I know...

s/nodes/node/ in both of the two lines above.

The idle-state property isn't documented in the list of properties above.

The indentation above is a mix of TABs and spaces, and is inconsistent
between nodes; just TABs would be best.

I'm not sure it's a good idea to have example bus nodes that are empty;
why not leave out two of the options, and put some device on each of the
buses that is defined?

Don't you need to multiply the size by mux->data->n_values?

Don't you need to multiple the size by sizeof(*gpios) here?
