Actually I didn't notice min() call above. So, you may ignore that part.

I don't see how it differs to what you wrote.

OK.

Consider the corner case when msg_len _is_ 1 at the beginning.
Then continue with 2. I really didn't see the difference in two
snippets. Perhaps you have a bug there.

Ditto.

You ignored some of my comments including this one. Why? Can you go
again through my rreview and answer the rest?

You may do it manually, right? There are examples for similar cases
like writing the offset into FIFO until it returns the written value
and FIFO maximum possible size is not achieved.
