Agreed.

If we decide to do this, it should be mv78230-i2c runs assuming it is
on the A0 variant.  mv78230-B0-i2c would permit offloading.

In theory, this is something that could be tweaked at runtime by the
bootloader.  But the bootloaders aren't there yet, and requiring a
bootloader upgrade isn't an option.  However, this is something that
should definitely be expressed in the DT.

I have no problem with doing both.  eg check for -B0-i2c, if that's
missing, retrieve the CPU variant and then enable/disable offloading.

thx,

Jason.
