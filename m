Are you saying that the aspeed HW is buggy and that this abnormal state
is self inflicted by the aspeed HW even if other masters on the bus
behave sanely? Because I didn't quite read it that way at all...

To me, it sounded *exactly* like the state I2C clients end up in when an
I2C master "dies" and stops communicating in the middle of a transaction.
I.e. the thing that the SMBus timeout is designed to prevent (and the
state the I2C nine-clk-recovery sequence addresses). The only twist (that
I saw) was that the aspeed HW is also a master and that the aspeed master
driver is completely locked out from the bus while some obnoxious master
fails to complete its transaction (or whatever it was up to).

If this can only be triggered when the HW is acting as a slave, and by
aborted or otherwise funky master activity on the bus, then I wouldn't
call it an HW issue. Then it would be a bus issue. I.e. something needing
a bus-timeout instead of a hw-timeout.

I don't have the specifics, so I can't tell which way it is. I'm just
reacting to the presented information.

Cheers,
Peter
