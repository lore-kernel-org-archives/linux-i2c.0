Ok, I see what you mean. I had a look at the place in question and
wonder what to return from i2c_add_mux_adapter() in the disabled
case so that i2c-mux-pinctrl is still happy with the returned value.

I guess what you want to have is that i2c_add_adapter() is not called
for the disabled case, right?

Is the i2c_adapter struct prepared in i2c_mux_add_adapter() still valid
if i2c_add_adapter() is not called?

Sorry, I am not too deep into i2c subsystem, I just reworked i2c-mux-
pinctrl to make it work on Dove. If you are fine with giving me some
guidance how you prefer to have it done, I can try to free some spare
time. Unfortunately there is already little of it, so please don't
expect a quick tested patch.
