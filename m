The bt869 driver was never ported to Linux 2.6, so no, I can't test it.
Not that I believe that the driver as it existed made much sense
anyway. It was more of an afternoon hack than anything else.
Controlling the video output using the BT869 should really be up to the
video driver (framebuffer or X) and not to the user.
