In fact, that's all about what the default should be, because user space
can very easily change it either way (it takes one loop in shell code to do
that for all devices on the given bus).

And I'm fine with defaulting to "auto".

There are platforms where those resources are simply not available for
direct manipulation and we need to use ACPI methods for power management.

Now, since those methods are used in pretty much the same way for all I2C
devices, we add a PM domain for that to avoid duplicating the same code in
all of the drivers in question (patch [2/2]).  Does that make sense to you?

We need that for exactly 3 buses: platform (already done), I2C and SPI.

No other bus types are going to use ACPI this way for PM, at least for the
time being, simply because PCI, USB and SATA/IDE have their own ways of doing
this (which are bus-specific) and the spec doesn't cover other bus types
directly (it defines support for UART, but we don't have a UART bus type).

Moreover, because PCI and USB use ACPI for PM in their own ways, moving that
thing up to the driver core would be rather inconvenient.

Thanks,
