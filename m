I agree with you. We could probably use 1 second as default which can
cover the most of general cases. If so, we don't need to make the
default setting in this driver because i2c-core-base will default
adap->timeout to 1 second if the value is 0 when a driver registers an
adapter. Will fix this code.

It followed the way of the existing i2c-mpc driver uses 'fsl,timeout'
for the same purpose. Though, I also want to make it as a generic as you
suggested like 'timeout' in milliseconds unit, not in microseconds unit.
If making it a generic property is acceptable, I'll fix it too.

Wolfram, can you please share your thought on it?

Thanks,
Jae
