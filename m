[Yuan Yao] 
Sorry for my unclear description. In fact, During the DMA transmission  if
an error happened or time out, DMA will stop at once and be disabled.
I just continue to route the TX and RX request to signal the DMA controller.
Because the DMA is disabled, it will ignore those signals.

In a word, I just want to block the I2C TX, RX and interrupt signal when
DMA mode failed until the next I2C transmission start.

In fact, the bit "I2CR_DMAEN" is a switch which decide whether I2C route
the TX, RX and interrupt signal to DMA controller.

[Yuan Yao] 
Yes, I have stopped the DMA immediately. However I keep the I2C DMA
single route.

I don't have the exact evidence to prove that my design is acceptable.
So if you are sure it's flawed, I will change it in the next version(V8).
