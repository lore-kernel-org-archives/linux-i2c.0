Sure, I might be bikeshedding, but...

No one has said "EPAPR requires compatible string heirarchies to be
handled as such."  Or, "EPAPR doesn't specify, so we choose to treat
them in such-and-such manner."

The point I'm trying to highlight in this case is that we aren't clear
on how we code compatible strings.  Yes, we use the most specific
compatible in the list, which is typically the first one.  What we
haven't cleared up is how to handle a newer IP with an older compatible
string.

eg: we boot an -a0 SoC, the dtb has the i2c node with most specific
compatible string 'mv78230-a0-i2c'.  Obviously, we disable offload.
What do we do with an older DTB which only has 'mv78230-i2c'? [see 1]

now we're running on a -b0 SoC.  We boot with a DTB that has a node
'mv78230-i2c'.  Is this an old DTB?  Or is this a new DTB written with
the understanding that -a0-i2c is an exception?  You see?  We aren't
being definitive.  The kernel really doesn't know for certain whether it
should enable offloading in this case or not.

[1] Yes, for Armada i2c, we can retrieve the CPU revision to wade out of
this grey area.  I'm just looking for clarification regarding the
general DT handling of this scenario.

I'm reluctant to push this series until I have an answer because the
answer will change the meaning of 'mv78230-i2c'.  Which *is* relevant to
this series.

Personally, I feel that since 'mv78230-i2c' has been used to refer to A0
revision of the IP, we should treat any nodes using it (as it's most
specific string) as having broken offloading.  Which implies that
-b0-i2c should be used to indicate IPs with working offloading.

I swear, I'm starting to feel like Russell...  Maybe I'm just grumpy
after crawling out from under my email backlog...

Yes, it's a fix, and it'll get in.  It might be too late for v3.13, but
it'll get in to v3.13.1 (and the other appropriate stable kernels).  I
don't like to rush fixes just because of a pending merge window.

thx,
