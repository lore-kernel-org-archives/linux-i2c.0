Yeah, it is present in the current code.  I hadn't seen any errata on
this issue, so that is why I was curious.  In many cases, the code in
the mainline driver was carried forward from the downstream CAF
driver.  I know the two don't look that similar in some regards, but
in most cases the actions taken are the same, even if it is not
obvious.

Right.  If the QUP has an issue and isn't processing data, and you
have a BAM transaction pending for this, you have to not only ack the
qup error, but also terminate the BAM transaction.

What test case are you using to test out the error path?  Something
other than NACKs?
