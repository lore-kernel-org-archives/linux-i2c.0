This series attempts to align as much IRQ handling into the
probe path as possible. Note that I don't have a great setup
for testing these patches so they are mostly just build tested
and need careful review and testing before any of them are
merged.

The series brings the ACPI path inline with the way the device
tree path handles the IRQ entirely at probe time. However,
it still leaves any IRQ specified through the board_info as
being handled at device time. In that case we need to cache
something from the board_info until probe time, which leaves
any alternative solution with something basically the same as
the current handling although perhaps caching more stuff.

Thanks,
Charles
