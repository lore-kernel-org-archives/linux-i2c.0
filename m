Yeah, I did expect we might run on a bit and get into the sleep which is
why I left the fallback for it in there.  I was trying to make as small
a change as possible so that the change would be robust, the performance
win is so dramatic.  I guess tuning up the number of spins would work
well in your case.

One idea that did occur to me while I was looking at this is to change
the code so that if the delay is long instead of waiting for the bus to
go idle at the end of the transaction we do so at the start of the next
transaction.  It's the next one that really cares that the bus has gone
idle, and in a lot of cases there's enough gap between the transactions
due to other work the CPU is doing to mean that there's no need to
explicitly wait at all.
