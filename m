hi Wolfram,

the mainline idea you mentioned is that you don't care about any early
device, which means some devices want to start earlier than others in
some real automative user scenerioes.
but i think another important idea is that mainline codes come from
branches of different vendors and serve final users of those drivers,
but not only make source codes no difference to all environments. the
auto users i2c-sirf serves, here, actually means some differences with
PC/tablet/mobilephone. we don't make codes good-looking by losing
functionality and not close to final users.

anyway, it is up to you to decide. i can definitely maintain the
difference locally.
