Is this really so useful on embedded systems?

I was under the impression that this method was something used
on say PC desktops with temperature monitors and EEPROMs
on some I2C link on the PCB, usage entirely optional and fun
for userspace hacks.

And when we say "people use it" do we mean "sensors-detect
uses it, on desktops", really?
