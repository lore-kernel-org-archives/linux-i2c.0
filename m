The old driver was marked as broken for the above reasons and I can hardly
imagine any setup in which it would be preferable to i2c-gpio. So it does
not make any sense to keep the old driver alive. Though inspired by the old
driver, the new one is almost a rewrite from scratch, so for better reviewing,
I removed the old instead of doing a diff.
