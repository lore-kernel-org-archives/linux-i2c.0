Ok, I've pulled this in by cherrypicking the commits.  I needed to add
the 'Fixes: ...' and 'Cc: stable ...' language, so the commit ids were
going to change anyhow.  I also added the note to the binding as we
discussed.  I've also based this against v3.13-rc1 as there doesn't
appear to be any need to drag in everything up to -rc6.

I've pushed this to mvebu/fixes.  Please take a look.  If it all looks
good I'll send the pull request off tomorrow.

thx,

Jason.
