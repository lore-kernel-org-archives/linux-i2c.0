But this assumption is wrong as I already wrote few days ago, mv78230-i2c
has been deployed referring to -b0 revision i2c IP blocks since the begining.

It was developed on and for B0 version, and this compatible was created for
this specific version. It was latter that we realized that it was not fully
compatible with A0. But for sure:

mv78230-i2c == I2C IP running on Armada XP B0 (or latter)
