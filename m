Are you suggesting that the hardware lock wouldn't mind being taken
twice by the AP side? If it is the case, then indeed the software mutex
is still needed to prevent it from happening.

That being said... I guess that avoiding a priority inversion is a good
enough reason to always take the rt_mutex, regardless of the hardware
lock implementation.

So, this patch is

Acked-by: Jean Delvare <khali-PUYAD+kWke1g9hUCZPvPmw@public.gmane.org>

I guess it makes more sense for me to let Ben apply it, as the other
two patches in the series are for him too. This will avoid a dependency
between our trees.
