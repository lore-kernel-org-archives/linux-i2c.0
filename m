Hi Wolfram,

The ZX2967 I2C driver submission had gone through quite a number of
review iterations [1], and seems close to be accepted.  But for some
reason, the ball got dropped from there.  I'm here to pick it up and
hopefully move it forward.

This is basically a resend of the latest posting from Baoyou with
Wolfram's comments on v7 fully addressed.

Changes since v7:
 - Rebase and test on v4.12-rc2.
 - Drop the dev_err() and hardware reset on timeout, which is not really
   necessary.
 - Return -ETIMEDOUT instead of -EIO on timeout.
 - Unify zx2967_i2c_xfer_write_bytes() and zx2967_i2c_xfer_read_bytes()
   into one function zx2967_i2c_xfer_bytes(), and zx2967_i2c_xfer_write()
   and zx2967_i2c_xfer_read() into zx2967_i2c_xfer_msg().
