Ahhh, now I see. Why is it that I have to hit send before I start to re=
alize
things? You have moved the RHR read from at91_do_twi_transfer()...

=2E..and there is no else before the TXCOMP|NACK, so I added a witness =
inside the
if (...RXRDY) that triggers if TXCOM|NACK is also set. That witness fir=
es at
about the same rate as the "RXRDY still set" message did before. For th=
rills I
readded the if (sr & AT91_TWI_RXRDY) check in at91_do_twi_transfer() bu=
t that
test is no longer firing.

So, yes, this is a good fix...

=2E..and you can scratch that comment.
