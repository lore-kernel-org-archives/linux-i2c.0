The workaround you are referring to is implemented under
"if (cdns_is_holdquirk(id, hold_quirk)) {"
and should not apply to your case of 128 byte transfer at all.

The specific place you have problem is under the loop
where RX data valid is being checked and ideally, that
buffer should never be written with more data than requested -
because no. of bytes requested is written to transfer size register,
the same is the amount the controller (master) fetches and
RX data valid remains set only for that duration.

Are you using Zynq?
I'm not working on this anymore but we could take a look at
your error if we are able to reproduce it.
Could you please provide more details of your application and
setup?

Regards,
Harini
