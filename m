You mean putting the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() into 88pm80x.h? No, that would
not work.

The correct way is to have two MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE statements, one per file.
Actually the table only makes sense for loadable modules, so if you decide
to keep the driver only built-in, it's best to just drop this table.

But there is nothing unified about the function above, it just calls
regmap_read(), so the caller already has access to the regmap pointer.

Then it needs to be exported, so the rtc driver can be a module.

Exactly. All the values that are only used by the core driver should be
part of the core driver (or a local header in the mfd directory if they
need to be shared between multiple files). The platform code should not
really touch the registers, but only things like the platform_data
structure, which indeed belongs into the global header.

regmap_add_irq_chip should pass -1, mfd_add_devices should pass 0.
Mark can probably correct me if that's wrong.

The drivers using the numbers need to call regmap_irq_get_virq() to get the
real interrupt number. See include/linux/mfd/wm8994/core.h for an example.
