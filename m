1) Regarding
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn919852(v=vs.85).aspx
, Window I2C driver should pass MITT test. There are 5 I2C devices
connect to one I2C bus for test. And those devices defined different
"ConnectionSpeed" over the I2C bus by ACPI resource "I2CSerialBus".

During test, I2C bus should run in different "ConnectionSpeed" of
device.

That means windows driver can modify I2C bus speed to match the
"ConnectionSpeed" of device on-the-fly. Static value from SSCN and FMCN
can not work for WITT test cases.

It sounds like odd that multi-speed can be applied over one I2C bus, But
everything goes well.
Does this behavior(multi-speed) violate the I2C spec?

2) In theory, I2C core driver also can get ACPI resource
"ConnectionSpeed" of device during creating new I2C device. 
Is it worth to add a new feature for parsing and using "ConnectionSpeed"
of device for determining bus speed?

3) For ACPI DW adapter, current driver only support Fast mode. I would
like to support other modes after previous 2 questions are clear.
