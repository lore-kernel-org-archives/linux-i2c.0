I think that I2C bus numbers are an internal concept for the OS. As 
such, we should probably remove any mention re: the bus numbers from the 
binding.

What about gaps in the numbering sequence? IIRC, in a situation with 5 
nodes with reg 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 but where only the nodes with reg of 1, 3 
enabled, we only want 2 entries in pinctrl-names? If so, "at the 
position of the child node's "reg" property" isn't correct, since "at 
the position" implies there must be gaps in pinctrl-names. "In the same 
order as the reg property values for enabled subnodes" might be a better 
description.

Perhaps I'm misremembering and you explicitly didn't want to remove 
entries from pinctrl-names if child nodes were disabled? If so, then 
surely then in the text above, "for each enabled child" should be 
replaced with "for each child"?

To make the example cover more cases, perhaps make child node i2c@0 
disabled and i2c@1 enabled. Then, the example would show what happens to 
pinctrl-names when there are gaps in the reg property numbering space of 
enabled children?
