If you have a pin controller, and you make a typo in your device tree
which leads to a wrong phandle and devm_pinctrl_get returning -EINVAL,
the system won't mux the pins... And that will certainly affect normal
I2C operation!

IMHO, it is just stupid to ignore errors and then let the developer
later on trace back what the initial issue was. Error out early is a
common sense software design principle...

I am not asking for a panic(), I am just suggesting to only ignore
pinctrl if it returns -ENODEV, the case you care are about.
