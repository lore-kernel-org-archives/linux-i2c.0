If the transfer times out, whatever the reason, we clear the fifo
(and disable). Doesn't that get us back to IDLE?

Code with my patches:

static int bcm2835_i2c_xfer(struct i2c_adapter *adap, struct i2c_msg msgs[],
                 int num)
{
[...]
     bcm2835_i2c_start_transfer(i2c_dev);

     time_left = wait_for_completion_timeout(&i2c_dev->completion,
                         adap->timeout);
     if (!time_left) {
         bcm2835_i2c_writel(i2c_dev, BCM2835_I2C_C,
                    BCM2835_I2C_C_CLEAR);
         dev_err(i2c_dev->dev, "i2c transfer timed out\n");
         return -ETIMEDOUT;
     }
