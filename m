As far as I remember reason for that was to prevent suspending the 
device when unloading the driver.

That will trigger power down after returning from dw_i2c_plat_remove() 
by looking at debug print from acpi_device_set_power() but now I don't 
find what call chain is actually causing it.

Must be something to do with drivers/acpi/acpi_lpss.c and notifier calls 
from drivers/base/dd.c. Also I was wondering why RPM usage counts don't 
increase monotonically over repeated module load/unload cycle.

I had a few paper notes about these when I last time looked and debugged 
PM in i2c-designware but throw away them :-(
