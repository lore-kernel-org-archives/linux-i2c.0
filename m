If the application was using i2c_smbus_read/write_byte_data from
user-space, then a kernel driver would call the same functions. No
reason why this wouldn't work.

Couldn't find the datasheet for this one, unfortunately.

The tlv320aic32x4 driver uses i2c_master_send, which is a shortcut to
i2c_transfer. However it seems to only send 2 bytes on the bus at once,
the same could be achieved with i2c_smbus_write_byte_data if needed.

For completeness: a device might use transactions which are compliant
with SMBus without being formally "SMBus-compliant", because SMBus has
more constraints than just transaction types (I kept things simple
originally to not confuse you.) This may explain why it isn't mentioned
in the datasheet. Or just because the manufacturer did not care because
they target fully I2C-capable systems anyway.

What you have to look at is the transaction types. They are usually
described in the datasheet. Then compare with either the SMBus
specification or
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/i2c/smbus-protocol
and if they match then you can use the i2c_smbus_*() calls.

You're welcome.
