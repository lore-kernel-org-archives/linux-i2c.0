Changes from V3:
- rebase on i2c/for-next
- Add patches to convert other drivers using gpio recover to gpiod
- Remove legacy gpio
- Address minor issues raised in review and add acks received so far

Changes from V2:
- Rebase on https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wsa/linux.git/
  i2c/for-next
  No intentional changes, but needed to move i2c_dw_plat_prepare_clk to common
  for the master recovery functions to use. which is included as two additional
  patches.

Changes from V1:
- In review Andy suggested change the i2c core to use the gpiod
  I've added a patch that allows the gradual switching of drivers 
  to using gpiod interface. The old interface is preserved so
  that changes can be made incrementally.
- I've update Tim's patch for the designware driver to use the new
  interface. Tweaked a couple of things to his patch and fixed
  up things Andy id in last review. 
  The core changes in p1 don't require the get/set scl/sda functions.
  Hopefully I've done the right thing with preserving authorship and
  signoff.
