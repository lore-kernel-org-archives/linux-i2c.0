Can you be more explicit about the problem here? Why does anything need 
to be re-written if a child node is disabled; presumably there's no need 
for the child bus numbers to be contiguous. In other words, with the 
example in the existing DT binding doc:

         i2cmux {
                 compatible = "i2c-mux-pinctrl";
...
                 pinctrl-names = "ddc", "pta", "idle";
                 pinctrl-0 = <&state_i2cmux_ddc>;
                 pinctrl-1 = <&state_i2cmux_pta>;
                 pinctrl-2 = <&state_i2cmux_idle>;

                 i2c@0 {
                         reg = <0>;
...
                 i2c@1 {
                         reg = <1>;
...

That would generate child busses 0 and 1. If I was to disable the i2c@0 
node, then there would still be definitions for child busses 0 and 1 in 
the DT, it's just that child bus 0 wouldn't actually exist at run-time. 
I don't see what part of DT needs to be re-written to accomodate this?

I would have assumed that disabled sub-nodes was a global concept within 
DT, and so wouldn't be mentioned in the binding. It would just be a bug 
in the driver if it didn't ignore disabled sub-nodes.

The addition there seems fine, but the existing text re: the idle state 
seems clearer in the original text.
