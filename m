Hi Ivan,

   Sorry resending again, because wrapping seemed to be
   somehow wrong in my previous response.

I see that QUP specs defines up to 1MHZ as fast+ speed.

The one of the reason for this and the bam support patches in
this series was to support multiple transfers of i2c_msgs without
  a 'stop' inbetween them. So without that the driver sends a 'stop'
between each sub-transfer. The v2 of this series supported that only in
bam mode and not in non-bam mode. That was a bug. I saw the difference
in behavior between bam and non-bam mode while testing with a hdmi adv
bridge recently. So added the support in this series. This was neede to
bringup the HDMI adv bridge device. I could have added it as a
  new patch to make it more explicit.

For this and the above, i will change the groupings and split this patch
  in to couple of smaller ones.

  The above is true for a single subtransfer for reading/writing
more than > 256 bytes. But for doing WRITE, READ kind of sub
  transfers once the first sub transfer (write) is over, and
  while re-configuring the _COUNT registers for the next transfers,
'a stop' between is inserted.
To avoid this,the MX_CONFIG_DURING_RUN  bit should be set while in
  'RUN' state, before re-configuring for the next sub transfer.
  The qupspec calls this as bus 'lock-unlock' feature.

I tested this and it fixed the wrong data reads in the case of the hdmi
adv bridge reads. It was doing 2 i2c_msgs transfers for each i2c_xfer
call.  The data read was wrong without this patch in v1 mode (default)
and even in v2 mode without the lock-unlock even though we do not send
a 'STOP' tag command between sub-transfers.

if the first allocation pass and second one fails, and i will have

  Write/read fifo functions (also for V1) currently wait for the
   fifo full and empty flags conditions. This will ensure that the
  fifo full and empty conditions are taken care before writing
  and reading. But this can be improved by waiting for
  block_write/read flags to improve the throughput.

  This function is not entered with controller in PAUSED state
  Only in Reset state (for the first transfer) and Run state for
  the subsequent sub-transfers. The reason for having this 'run'
  variable was that while using the lock-unlock feature, the
  controller should not be put in to run-reset-run state
  in-between transfers.

  sorry. Did confuse my response last time. This +rx_tag_len is
  not needed here and infact it is '0' in case of v1.

ok, the read and write fifo timing out error checks should be
  corrected once i check the error code for qup_i2c_wait_ready
  function.

I will split this patch in to couple of smaller patches and make
  sure it does not look complex.
