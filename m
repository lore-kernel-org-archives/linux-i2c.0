From: "Edward A. James" <eajames@us.ibm.com>

This series adds an algorithm for an I2C master physically located on an FSI
slave device. The I2C master has multiple ports, each of which may be connected
to an I2C slave. Access to the I2C master registers is achieved over FSI bus.

Due to the multi-port nature of the I2C master, the driver instantiates a new
I2C adapter for each port connected to a slave. The connected ports should be
defined in the device tree under the I2C master device.

Changes since v2:
 * None. Not sure how two v2s ended up on the list, sorry.

Changes since v1:
 * Switch "port" to "i2c-bus" for child nodes in the dt.
 * Switch "port" to "reg" dt property.
 * Add example device under i2c-bus node in docs.
 * Set of_node of I2C adapter.
 * Use dynamically allocated numbering for I2C adapters.
 * Remove ida counters; unnecessary.
