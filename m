OK, the i2c series is off the hook.

Felipe and I spent a little time tracking this down.  Felipe suggested
that there might be a driver with periodic i2c activity keeping I2C
awake, and thus preventing CORE retention.  He was right.

On the boards where I'm seeing the failure, the RTC is firing every
second, and since the RTC is on the I2C connected PMIC, the PMIC IRQ
reads and the RTC reads are causing lots of I2C activity every second.  

With the new autosuspend feature, that is enough to keep the I2C active
continually and prevent CORE retention.

So, all that to say, from my PoV, this series can go in as is.  The PM
problem is caused by the RTC driver someplace.

Thanks Felipe,

Kevin
