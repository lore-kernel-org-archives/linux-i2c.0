Hum ok. I am going to double-check what is wrong because when I check
with the scope I always reach 400Khz for SCL.
I will let you know.

This is not correct.
Setting STOP/START bit does not mean the the pulse will be sent right now.
Here we have just to prepare the hardware for the 2 next pulse but the
STOP/START/ACK pulse will be generated at the right time as required
by I2C specification.
So SMBus block transfer will be possible.

I don't think so.
stm32f4_i2c_handle_rx_addr() is called once during adress match phase.
It is used to configure the I2C controller according to the number of
data to be received as it has to be done in a different way according
to the number of data to received:
- single byte reception
- 2-byte reception
- N-byte reception
Then, as soon as, the controller is correctly configured, for each
byte to be received, we use stm32f4_i2c_handle_read() or
stm32f4_i2c_handle_rx_done().
stm32f4_i2c_handle_read() is used to read  data for a single byte
reception or until N-2 data for N-byte reception
stm32f4_i2c_handle_rx_done() is used to read data for a 2-byte
reception, or  data N-2, N-1 and N for a N-byte reception.
So, single-reception and longer transfer have been clearly managed in
a different way.

Ok I will add a comment for that.

ACK bit is set in  stm32f4_i2c_handle_rx_addr().
As explained above, this function is called once during address match phase=
.
So, this bit is set only once just before receiving the first data byte.
