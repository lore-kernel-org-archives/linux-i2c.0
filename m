In the most simple case, your I2C bus has a single segment so "segment"
or "bus" mean the same thing.

It only starts mattering when I2C bus multiplexing comes into play.
Then your bus is split into segments, with one segment (trunk) between
the master (controller) and the multiplexer, and one or more segments
(branches) hanging off the multiplexer.

Take look at
https://i2c.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/I2C_bus_multiplexing
for a sample topology.

But anyway the comment in front of i2c_lock_adapter() is somewhat
misleading. If you read the code you'll see that it always locks the
whole bus tree, because it uses the root segment's mutex.

This is for a specific case. The general case is handled by the
per-adapter mutex for years now. 2.6.32 should be just fine in this
respect.

Best is to look at a driver for a device which is similar in
functionality to yours.
