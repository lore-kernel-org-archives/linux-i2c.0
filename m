Is it ok to export it in 88pm80x.h?

After you suggest to change the r/w API so that caller doesn't care about it's
via i2c or spi, it makes sense. However due to pm800 has 3 i2c devices, and
it's hard to export such interface for pm800. Currently to add such interface
via regmap handle, caller still doesn't care about the actual hw implement,
also it's clear that all pm80x sub-driver or plat call the unified r/w API.

It's used by rtc driver.

These registers still in this header file are either used by mfd core
driver, regulator/rtc/onkey/codec, or used in platform initial setting.

Pm80x_chip is common for both pm800 and pm805, while pm80x_subchip
handles the other i2c devices as discussed before, only that these two
i2c devices are not as much as pm800 and pm805 i2c device, and they are
only for gpadc & power settings purpose. The subchip can be treated as
some special feature/function for pm800.

Actually it's convenient for us to put it back currently, and would use
auxdata instead.

Do you mean that both regmap_add_irq_chip and mfd_add_devices api pass -1 as
the irq_base, so that system can dynamically allocate the irq_base for it?
Given the proper regmap_irq_chip & device resource, is there anything else
needed? As I don't want to miss the exact meaning of " transform the
interrupt numbers using the domain in the client drivers" you mentioned above.
