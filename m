Ok. The word "Enable" is a good hint. I'll change this.

IHMO, it does not matter. A separate patch which make use of it is alre=
ady
ready to post. If this patch is accepted, the second one will be posted=
=2E It=20
is not worth to add a comment then remove it in the next patch.

It is included by the tdfx.h which is vital to the tdfxfb.c.

>=20

Just a choice. One other driver does it this way. I'll change to
the proposed names.

It works on Voodoo5 at least.

I don't care. First, this patch must be accepted.=20
