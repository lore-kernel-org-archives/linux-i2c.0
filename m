The regression is gone with this patch (vanilla 4.2), thank you!

However, looking at the bus, there are two NACKs after each
successful chunk of memory written by the eeprom driver.

Looking at the eeprom driver, I expect this on the bus:

S 0x50 0x00 "hello there guys" P
S 0x50 NACK P
delay for at least 1 ms (since the eeprom driver has a msleep(1) call).
S 0x50 NACK P
delay for at least 1 ms
...
...
S 0x50 NACK P
delay for at least 1 ms
S 0x50 0x10 "and girls\n" P

This is not what I observe on the bus, most of the time there is a
second NACK immediately following the first. I suspect that it is
the i2c bus driver that somehow confuses itself and reissues the
command for some reason?

But this behavior has been there since the beginning, so it's probably
orthogonal, and killing the data corrupting regression is much more
important to me than fussing over a surplus failed transfer. Hence
