I have started to get this when I run with this patch:

My USB serial dongle was hung which was why I didn't notice until just =
now.

This is probably not when communication with the eeprom though, and cer=
tainly not
writing to it, but perhpaps when polling the temperature (using the jc4=
2 driver).
I'll investigate further in the morning to see if I can pinpoint it.

Cheers,
Peter
