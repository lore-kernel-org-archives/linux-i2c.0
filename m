With this number we are sure to have always an information even if the
SoC ID or version was unknown by the kernel.

Yes it is doable, but then we also need to update the mvebu_pcie_of_match_table.
However I would prefer doing this as a separate patch because this one is
for fixing a bug. Later we can improve the kernel.
