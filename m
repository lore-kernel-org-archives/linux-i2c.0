I don't find it less confusing, for my point of view the interface of a
bus is the lines interfacing the bus with the devices on this bus. But I
don't mind modifying it, as I clearly state that the first clock is the
one used to generate the clock of the i2c bus, so we can change the
name.

No I am not sure :)
Actually I don't have this information, so lets call it "reg" for
register clock.
