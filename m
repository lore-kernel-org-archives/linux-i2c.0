Hi Gao,

I'm adding the linux-i2c list to Cc.

Unfortunately struct i2c_msg is part of the user-space ABI so you don't
get to modify it.

What you can do is add a check on "count" in both i2c_master_send() and
i2c_master_recv() so that messages which will not fit are rejected
rather than being silently truncated. Alternatively, the count
parameters could be turned into u16, so that the limitation is
immediately visible. This would be more efficient.

I don't think it makes a lot of sense to transfer more than 64 kB at
once over I2C. I don't know at which speed you operate your bus, but
even at 400 kHz, it takes 1.5 second to transfer 64 kB. At the regular
100 kHz, it takes no less than 6 seconds. This incurs pretty high
latency over the bus in question... Not to mention the system in its
entirety if your bus is backed by the never-sleeping i2c-algo-bit or
similar.

So if the hardware allows it, you should simply split the firmware in
smaller chunks so that it fits into the current interface.

If this is really impossible, then we'd have to introduce a new
structure for these long messages. As we can't use these in user-space
for compatibility reasons, we would have to translate from one
structure type to the other and back for every user-space transaction.
Obviously there would be a performance penalty, which is why I'd like
to avoid it if possible.
