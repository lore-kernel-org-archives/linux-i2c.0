Unfortunately there is no other way to get this ID. It is not a
"traditional" way of doing it, it just the only way to get this
information given the design of the hardware

yes it fails but then this function exits with an error (a more accurate
error in the next version). It will be the responsibility of the code which
need this information to check that this function won't fail. For the i2c
driver, for instance, we will switch on the safe mode and it won(y use
the offload mechanism.
