I don't agree. E.g. -EINVAL would appear if you pass devm_pinctrl_get an
invalid device. Currently you would silently ignore that, which is not
what you want.

You want to get the pinctrl in any case expect there isn't one. And that
is how you should formulate your if statement.

/*
 * It is ok if no pinctrl device is available. We'll not be able to use
the 
 * bus recovery feature, but otherwise the driver works fine...
 */
if (PTR_ERR(i2c_imx->pinctrl) != -ENODEV)
