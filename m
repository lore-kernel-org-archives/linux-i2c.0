Hmm, looking at of_i2c_register_devices():

	for_each_available_child_of_node(adap->dev.of_node, node)
		of_i2c_register_device(adap, node);

already honors status properties by using for_each_available_foo.
Therefore, i2c-core will also skip i2c device nodes disabled by
status property.

I am not too deep into i2c-core, but AFAIKS i2c-mux-pinctrl is not an
i2c device but an i2c mux that is dealt with differently? It is not
probed with of_i2c_register_devices() but as a separate platform_device
with a reference to the parent i2c bus.

About the memory allocation for the maximum potential number of muxes:
We would need some way to distinguish disabled from enabled muxes in
i2c-mux-pinctrl's platform_data.

i2c_mux_pinctrl_probe() is basically DT-agnostic and it should
definitely stay that way. Currently, each mux within pd->bus_count
requires a non-NULL pd->pinctrl_states[i] otherwise _probe() will bail
out for all sub-busses.

We could rework it to

(a) deal with each sub-bus individually with respect to 
pinctrl_lookup_state() and i2c_add_mux_adapter()

and

(b) allow (and skip) muxes with pinctrl_states[i] == NULL for now and
let the "maniac" deal with storing/re-probing the corresponding
pinctrl_state name once it gets dynamically enabled.

I am still not too eager working on it but if you insist, I can see
what I can do as long as Stephen sticks with testing it on Tegra. ;)
