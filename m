Yeah, makes sense. However there are drivers that deduce some parameters
only from the 'compatible' property, let's take drivers/dma/mxs-dma.c as an
example. I'm just trying to understand if there is a general preference on
how to handle those things. Of course we could have all detail properties
listed in a .dtsi file. But since we can derive these from a single property,
it might be more sensible to avoid parsing ?

OK, but wouldn't it be needed to resolve an IP revision at run time, e.g.
with soc_is_*() anyway ? Having it set at each board doesn't look like an 
optimal method either.
