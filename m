Honestly, I have no strong opinion about it. As you said you approach is
simple and easy to read.

About performances, I assume that both solutions are pretty the same for
small number of data. If the number increases, using the RXFL field
should give better results.

So I would say, maybe add a note in the commit log or in the code to
keep in mind there is this solution to go further.

Otherwise
