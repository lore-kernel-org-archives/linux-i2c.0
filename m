As far as I can tell driver's suspend hook does the clock gating so why
would you need to handle it differently? Once the device is runtime
suspended, it is both clock and power gated depending on the platform.

Well, it sounds a bit silly to resume the device just because you want
to call i2c_dw_disable() for it before suspending again ;-)

At least, it would be nice to check if we can keep it runtime suspended
with the help of 'dev->power.direct_complete'. If not possible, then I
suppose your patch is sufficient.
