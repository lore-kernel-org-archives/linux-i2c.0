To justify the need for hardware lock, lets take a real usecase scenario -
    
In case of Marvell SoC, PXA910 silicon, both AP and CP are present and
these two ARM cores are sharing one pair of I2C pins.
    
In order to keep I2C transaction operated with atomic, hardware lock
(RIPC) is required.
    
This patch extends support for atomic operation by adding hardware lock support
to the i2c-core.

PATCH[1/3] : Core changes for hardware lock
PATCH[2/3 & 3/3] : hardware lock support to i2c-pxa bus driver.

TODO:
  - DT node addition
    I am using PXA1928 based platform which is still not available
    in Mainline, once the base dts file gets merged, will submit patch
    for I2C support. Hopefully by that time I should have PMIC client driver
    support available.
