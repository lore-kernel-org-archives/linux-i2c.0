I didn't hear any response, so the PNX4008 patches are still hanging
around unmerged, and now have rejects.

I'm not attached to these patches so I'm not going to be putting any
additional effort into them (which means I'm not going to be putting
any effort into fixing those rejects or trying to get them merged)
especially as it means that they're now going to have to be maintained
by someone for three months...
