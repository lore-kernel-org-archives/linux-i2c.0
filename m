However, if you list these settings separately, rather than selecting them
based on a compatible string, it means when other board designs come along,
you don't have to modify the kernel code to provide yet another compatible
to settings translation in the code - you can keep all that information
entirely within DT with no kernel code mods.

I thought that was partly the point of DT...
