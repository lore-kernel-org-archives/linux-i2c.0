But for existing drivers which already support runtime PM (at least 7 by
a quick grep), they will be stuck runtime enabled and stop hitting
low-power states after this patch.

Why the set_active here?

For hardware that is disabled/powered-off on startup, there will now be
a mismatch between the hardware state an the RPM core state.
