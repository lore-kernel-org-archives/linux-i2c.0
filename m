Hmm. To me that's a weird way of implementing this.

Moreover, as i2c_dw_disable() indeed is called in ->remove() how will
the pm_runtime_forbid() help to avoid that from happen?

Oh, I didn't realize that by power down you meant the acpi power down.

Can you elaborate on why power down needs to be prevented?

Is there a problem to power on the device again in the next ->probe() attempt?

$subject patch changes this, as I didn't think that was really the
wanted behaviour.

Perhaps acpi doesn't power down the device in case the runtime PM
usage count > 0. I will have look and see what I can dig out.

Okay, I see.

Seems like we definitely need to do some more testing on acpi enabled platforms.

Kind regards
