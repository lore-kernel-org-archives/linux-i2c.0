OK, got your point.

Hmm, I do see there's deferred probe for the i2c hosts. something like:

[    0.177338] platform f7fcc000.i2c: Driver i2c_designware requests probe deferral

Is it possible as this:

probe => driver return EPROBE_DEFER => pm_request_idle() => probe again
=> since the device usage count is zero, once rpm is enabled, we have
chance to suspend?

And from another side, is it reasonable to always increase the usage count
until probe is done?

Thanks,
Jisheng
