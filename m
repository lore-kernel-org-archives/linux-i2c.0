I may be mis-understanding here but when two client wants to
communicate with same master and at the same
time how does that happen?
In the thread I mentioned client pulls the line low indicating that
it wants to own the bus and waits for some time and then checks
if the line is still low or not.If it is still low then it owns the bus
and start transaction and if clients see otherwise it releases the
bus and tries again after some time.How is that handled in the
previous kernel?
