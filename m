actually there are many drivers under mfd which have this common issue, 
which has i2c dummy devices, such as max77693.c, max8925-i2c.c, 
ab3100-core.c, max8997.c, max8998.c, s5m-core.c etc. some use regmap 
handle directly as param in exported r/w api, some add extra param to 
differentiate i2c dummy. it seems to be a common scenario. how do we 
handle the API in short term and long term?
