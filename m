No problem there was a lot of email just for this simple fix!

Please use my branch because as I wrote you:
https://github.com/MISL-EBU-System-SW/mainline-public/tree/i2c-mv64xxx-3.13-rc6-fixes-v6

I took into account the last minor review from Arnd and Wolfram, and I
also updated all the flags acked-by and reported-by. But if you prefer
I can just sent a 6th version on the mailing list.

Thanks,

Gregory
