It can never be done in all cases, since in some cases the
open drain config is just a property of the line and not controlled
by software at all, and the datasheet just says this line is open
drain.

But we should cover the cases where we deal with pure
SW-controlled configs as far as possible.

Yes...

I figured so much. But we have a consumer in i2c-core.c doing
this for a valid reason.

ACPI has an open drain/source flag for some GPIO lines IIRC.

I think this doesn't need to go all the way down into the driver
actually. We can call to pinctrl in the gpiolib core and
keep the gpiochip API simple. The GPIO driver doesn't even need
to know this.

I think we need that.

I objected already when the OPEN_DRAIN et al were added,
but to no avail...

Make sense.

Yeah, but as seen from the I2C core, the algorithm there needs
to know if the input is always valid or not, and take different
execution paths depending on that. :-/
