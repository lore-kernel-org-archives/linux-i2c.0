Jason,

if it can help you I have just pull my branch at:
https://github.com/MISL-EBU-System-SW/mainline-public/tree/i2c-mv64xxx-3.13-rc6-fixes-v6

git@github.com:MISL-EBU-System-SW/mainline-public.git

I also taken into account the two comments and added the acked-by from Wolfram and
Arnd on the appropriate commit.


Thanks,

Gregory
