QUP from version 2.1.1 onwards, supports a new format of i2c command tags.
Tag codes instructs the controller to perform a operation like read/write.
This new tagging version supports and is required for adding bam dma
capabilities. V2 tags supports transfer of more than 256 bytes in a single
i2c transaction. Also adding bam dma support facilitates transferring each
i2c_msg in i2c_msgs without a 'stop' bit in between which is required for some
of the clients.

Tested this series on apq8074 dragon board eeprom client on i2c bus1

[V4] Added a patch to factor out some common code.
     Removed support for freq > 400KHZ as per comments.
     Addressed comments from Ivan T. Ivanov to keep the code for
     V2 support in a separate path. 
     Changed the authorship of V2 tags support patch.

[V3] Added support to coalesce each i2c_msg in i2c_msgs for fifo and
     block mode in Patch 2. Also addressed further code comments.
