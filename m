Due to the way the TDA998x works, it doesn't have much to do with the TV.
The TDA998x is instructed to read up to 128 bytes of EDID data into its
own internal buffer.  It then does so, and raises an interrupt (or we
notice that the interrupt flag is set when there's no hardware interrupt
line), and we then read the EDID data out of the TDA998x.

At the point we're reading from the TDA998x, it has loaded the data from
the DDC bus and the DDC bus is idle... we don't have direct access to
the DDC bus.

The only reason I can think that the checksum would pass is if you were
somehow ending up with data in the buffer that did cause the basic
checksum to pass, even though you had an incomplete read.
