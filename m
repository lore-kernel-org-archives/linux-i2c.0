I see. I wonder why it works so well for me then?
Could we just print a warning and continue?
The general advice for the kernel is not to bail out if
hardware is not optimally configured, but continue with
a warning that maybe not everything is all right.

So blocking the probe because we are not 100% sure the hardware
will work is against established practice: the established practice
is to be liberal with letting probe() continue, but emit a warning.

In my case that is good because it makes the hardware probe
and work without any visible problems.

I *can* try to traverse the device tree upwards from the mux node
to find the parent I2C controller and its "clock-frequency"
property. I felt that was hackish, but if you prefer the hack I
can try to use that.
