Hi Andrew,

[added Jason, Sebastian and Ezequiel in case they have better ideas]
[I also changed the order of the chunk of this email to make it easier
for the new comer to understand the subject]

We can have this information in the same way that it is currently done
by the other mvebu SoC: accessing the PCIE_DEV_REV_OFF register. In
arch/arm/plat-orion/pcie.c there were functions named
orion_pcie_dev_id() and orion_pcie_dev_id() to retrieve information
about the CPU variant and its version.

We could the same in drivers/pci/host/pci-mvebu.c, however it would
add a dependency between PCIe and I2C for the mvebu SoCs. I can think
of several options:

1. Using only a new compatible strings: mv78230-A0-i2c. The benefits
of it are that it is very easy to implement and it don't touch anything
else than the driver itself. The drawback is that we need to add an
new dts file for the A0 variant of the AX3-4.

2. Using the CPU revision information from the pcie driver. The
benefits of it are that we don't need modify any device tree and a fix
in the kernel will be enough. The drawback is that we introduce a
dependency between PCIe and I2C.

3. Using the CPU revision information as primary solution and the
compatible string as fallback. The benefits of it are there won't be a
mandatory dependency between PCI and I2c and the change of the dts
won't be mandatory too. The drawback is that we could have a non
working kernel if on a Rev A0 CPU, PCIe is not enable _and_
mv78230-A0-i2c compatible string is not selected.

I am open to other ideas as I am not found of none of them.


Thanks,

Gregory
