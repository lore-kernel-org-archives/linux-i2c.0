yes, you are right. yours is closer to the scl clock what we want to set.

But if (clk_rate * low_ratio) can not be divisible by (scl_rate * 8 * ratio_sum),
div_low will be round up, and div _high will be round down.
The gap between div_low and div_high is increased.

so maybe we can set:
div_high = DIV_ROUND_UP(clk_rate * high_ratio, scl_rate * 8 * ratio_sum)
div_low = DIV_ROUND_UP(clk_rate, scl_rate * 8) - div_low

i2c rate is 128Mhz:
1) calculate div_high first:
div_high = DIV_ROUND_UP(clk_rate * high_ratio, scl_rate * 8 * ratio_sum)
div_low = DIV_ROUND_UP(clk_rate, scl_rate * 8) - div_low

req = 400000, act = 400000, div_high = 13, div_low = 27

2) calculate div_low first:
div_low = DIV_ROUND_UP(clk_rate * low_ratio, scl_rate * 8 * ratio_sum)
div_high = DIV_ROUND_UP(clk_rate, scl_rate * 8) - div_low

req = 400000, act = 400000, div_high = 12, div_high = 28

I think that the first is more appropriate.
