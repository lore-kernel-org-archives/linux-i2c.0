Looking into the patch, clearing the interrupt status at the end of an
interrupt handler is always suspicious and tends to result in race
conditions (because additional interrupts may have arrived while handling
the existing interrupts, or because interrupt handling itself may trigger
another interrupt). With that in mind, the following patch fixes the
problem for me.
