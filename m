Ok. Thanks and sorry for delayed reply - missed your e-mail :(
I'll resend them next week.

This is ancient code. And regarding your question -
Might be it would be reasonable to add call of
i2c_davinci_wait_bus_not_busy() at the end of i2c_davinci_xfer()?
This way we will wait for Bus Free before performing recovery.

Of course,  i2c_davinci_wait_bus_not_busy() has to be fixed first
as proposed by Alexander Sverdlin here:
