I will try to submit something as knowing the variant and the revision
of the SoCs will be very useful.

That means changing the meaning of the actual compatible string
mv78230-i2c.

I would do this in the opposite order: probed value would prevail over
the static one.

My plan is:

First introducing a new compatible string and handle it in the driver.
Theses patches will be simple and small enough to be applied on the
current rc kernel and the stable kernels. I will also add a new dts
file: armada-xp-a0-openblocks-ax3-4.dts (and maybe introduce adding
also a armada-xp-common-openblocks-ax3-4.dtsi file). A0 SoCs are no
more shipped, that's why I try to provide a solution which uses the B0
SoC by default and which makes the A0 the exception.

Then adding a way to get the variant and the revision of the SoCs.

Finally using this information in the i2c-mv64xxx driver to decide to
enable or not the offloading, and using the compatible string as a
fallback.

Thanks,

Gregory
