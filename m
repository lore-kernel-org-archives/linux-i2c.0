Thanks I think I know understand how this transfer register is set up.
I will add some diagnostic printk's to track down exactly how it is
failing and get back to you.

 Yes it is zynq. The test case is large (128 byte) transfers from a
tpm to fill an rng driver. I just pull large amounts of data via dd.

It may depend on the i2c slave being willing to just respond to
requests that read arbitrary amounts of data. In this case the TPM
appeared to generate FF when requested for more data than was in the
TPM_RANDOM request.

Ah I can see the logic now. If the transfer is small (< 250 or so
bytes) it will just write it into the transfer register. Yes my
transfers are only 128 + some TPM related headers ( not big I expect).

Yes - I will get back to you with more details and further debugging
around exactly how it is failing.

Assuming it is not obvious how to fix it - perhaps I can try setting
the transfer register to zero when it hits the end of the transfer?
(if recv_count == 0).

Thanks very much Harini  - that was just the pointer I needed to
follow the code.
