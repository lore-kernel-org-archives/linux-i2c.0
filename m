I also think it could be useful to have a way to know the SoC ID and its
revision. But I don't know where to export it, in /proc/cpuinfo there is a
filed named Revision but I think it refers the board itself. There is also
the /sys/bus/platform/devices/soc.0/ directory which would be a good candidate
to export the SoC ID and revision.

I have just written something like that:
