The final call is obviously to Ben, not me, as this driver falls under
his jurisdiction. But for what it's worth, I consider the small-steps
rule void when it comes to fixing a plain broken driver by almost fully
rewriting it. The reviewer should really review the resulting code
rather than the patch. If it makes everybody happier, then killing the
old code completely first is certainly an option.
