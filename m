Looks like, it all boils down to how many I2C devices should be allowed
for runtime PM by default and how many I2C devices should be forbidden.
, and then we allow/forbid runtime PM for the majority case in I2C core
while individual driver can still forbid/allow it in their own code.

So if the majority case is runtime PM should be allowed by default, I'm
also OK to not forbid runtime PM for I2C client device in I2C core. My
original intention to forbid runtime PM by default is to make sure no
adverse effect would occur to some I2C devices that used to work well
before runtime PM.

Thanks,
Aaron
