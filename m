I don't think there is such a rule for this case, as if we "believe" the
Developer Manual, but do the opposite - we can get into trouble...
IMHO, at least we need to report a problem.

Or may be in some way reset the slave device,
if there is such an option available outside the i2c scope...
(Yeah, I know this is a crazy idea...)

1) Well, you should check if you have a pull-up resistors on that bus.
2) Or if the slave device chip is broken, then it should be replaced.
