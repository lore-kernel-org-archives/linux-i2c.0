The split between the two files looks very good now, I think this way
it makes much more sense for the reader.

According to what I discussed with Mark in the previous version, I think you
need to pass 0 instead of chip->irq_base here, and transform the interrupt
numbers using the domain in the client drivers.

Since these are separate modules now, you have to move the device table
into the split files as well.

In your introductory email you write

"Exported r/w API which requires regmap handle. as currently the pm800
chip has 3 i2c device, only passing a pm80x_chip info can't ensure r/w the
register in correct i2c device."

Your first driver version had this, then you removed the functions
after I asked you to, and now they are back, so I assume there is something
I don't see yet. It looks like the function is just an unnecessary wrapper
that is better open-coded in the caller. Can you explain again what the
difference is?

Unused function? Either export this if you want to provide it as
the general API, or drop the function.

I would think that these need to be exported as well, at least if
you want the driver to be modular.

I just noticed that it can currently only be builtin. Is there a strict
requirement for that? If not, better make it a tristate option.

If you do that, aside from adding the exports mentioned above, you have
to use three separate modules, as in

obj-$(CONFIG_MFD_88PM80X)	+= 88pm800-core.o 88pm805-core.o 88pm80x-i2c.o

or even

obj-$(CONFIG_MFD_88PM800)	+= 88pm800-core.o 88pm800-core.o
obj-$(CONFIG_MFD_88PM805)	+= 88pm800-core.o 88pm805-core.o

with the respective Kconfig change.

I would still argue that the majority of the constants in this file
should get moved into the driver .c file that uses them. Putting them
into the header is better done only for interfaces between the
driver parts, and for constants that are used by multiple drivers.

One thing I forgot to ask in the previous review although I had already
noticed it then: What is the separation of pm80x_chip and pm80x_subchip
used for?

You removed the callback here as I asked you to, which I think is a useful
cleanup, but you can actually managed to convinced me that it would be ok
to have it, so I don't mind if you want to put it back and use auxdata.

On the other hand, I think it probably makes sense to drop the irq_base
member in this struct and rely on irq domains to allocate them dynamically
as mentioned before.
