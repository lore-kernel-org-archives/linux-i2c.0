The stop condition is sent after every FIFO read but I only want the 
stop condition when the entire message has been sent (at msg_len == 1) 
which will be the last byte.

I see your point about a bug. I'm sending an extra byte. I'll fix it in 
the next revision. Thanks.

I'll check this one as well.

I wasn't aware of this function but it simplifies the code. I'll add it. 
Thanks.

I addressed most of your comments. In some cases, I grouped the comments 
together - for instance in the msg[], the comments addressed the same 
function.

While I agree that some FIFOs could be discovered that way, data pushed 
into this FIFO will be transmitted which isn't good.

Reading from the device tree is quite clean.  Additionally, there is a 
precedence for the "fifo-size" being read from the device tree in 
i2c-at91.c.

I have an addition question about a comment that isn't in this reply so 
I'm copying it here to keep the thread clean.

<snip> Copying my previous reply

After looking at this, I'm not clear what you mean. The 
i2c_algorithm.functionality parameter requires a function pointer which 
is why the altr_i2c_func() is assigned to that parameter as shown below. 
Am I missing something?

+
+static const struct i2c_algorithm altr_i2c_algo = {
+	.master_xfer = altr_i2c_xfer,
+	.functionality = altr_i2c_func,
+};

Thanks again for reviewing and for the helpful comments.
